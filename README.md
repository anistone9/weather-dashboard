Weather Dashboard To Retrieve Weather Data By City And Present A Five Day Forecast

## Description

This project represents a weather dashboard application that retrieves its data from the openweathermap.org 5-day API. The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the Javascript code. All search results are based off of two different APIs, one to convert a city name into geographical coordinates, and another to pull weather forecast data for those coordinates. 

The user is required to type a city name in the search box, and hit Submit. As the result is displayed for the current date and with a 5-day forecast on the right side of the screen, the result is also saved in local storage and displayed in the search history on the left side of the screen. Clicking one of the results in the search history displays the weather conditions again, for the current date and 5-day forecast.
